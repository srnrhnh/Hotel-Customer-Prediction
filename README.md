    <h1><b>Hotel Customer Prediction</b></h1>
</div>
This program is designed to predict whether a hotel customer will cancel their reservation. The analysis begins with data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure consistency and accuracy. It then uses machine learning models to predict customer cancellation behavior based on historical data. The aim of this project is to provide actionable insights that can help hotel management reduce cancellations and improve customer retention.

## **Data Sources üìä**
The dataset used in this project is from this [source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammaddawood42/hotel-booking-cancelations), which includes customer details, reservation information, and cancellation status in one daataset.

## **Technologies Used ‚öôÔ∏è**
- **Python** (data cleaning, preprocessing, machine learning model building, deployment script)
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** (data manipulation)
- **Scikit-Learn** (machine learning models)
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** (data visualization)

## **Method üöÄ**
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning (KNN, SVM, Random Forest, Ada Boost)
- Model Evaluation
- Model Inference
- Deployment

## **Key Insights & Conclusions üß†**
1. **Customer Diversity:**
   - Hotel customers have different behaviors and characteristics.
2. **Model Success:**
   - The project successfully predicted whether customers would cancel their reservations, helping improve retention.
3. **Key Factors Affecting Cancellations:**
   - Variables like `hotel`, `arrival_date`, `meal`, `country`, `market_segment`, `is_repeated_guest`, `booking_changes`, and others influence cancellation rates.
4. **Business Recommendations:**
   - Analyze customer data regularly to make better decisions.
   - Offer personalized promotions based on customer behavior.
   - Improve digital marketing to attract more customers.
5. **Impact on Marketing Strategy:**
   - **Customer Segmentation:** Better segmentation allows targeted marketing, especially for high-cancellation customers.
   - **Targeted Offers:** Hotels can offer incentives (like discounts or packages) to encourage bookings from high-risk customers.
   - **Improved Experience:** Understanding cancellation causes helps hotels improve customer communication and support.
6. **Model Strengths:**
   - The model does a good job predicting cancellations and providing useful insights.
7. **Model Weaknesses:**
   - The model may overfit, so it could be less accurate on new data. Improved feature engineering can help with this.
8. **Suggestions for Improvement:**
   - Better feature engineering and testing other models can improve the model's performance and accuracy.
